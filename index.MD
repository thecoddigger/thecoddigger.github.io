If you’re a developer working in any sort of team environment, tracking changes to a project’s source code is a vitally important aspect of the job.

In this course, Kevin Bowersox details several Git workflows that are popular with development teams. He details the main concepts behind these workflows, and shows how to choose the one that suits your needs—whether its Git Flow, GitHub Flow, or trunk-based development—to work more smoothly and eliminate pain points.
